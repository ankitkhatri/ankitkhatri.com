  My dearest Hridhaan, as your turn 0.5 today, on your dad’s birthday, here is
  my attempt to eternally Thank you for coming in our lives, giving us an

My dearest Hridhaan, as your turn 0.5 today, on your dad’s birthday, here is my attempt to eternally Thank you for coming in our lives, giving us an entirely new meaning of life and to share a few experiences as a father that will surely help you unfold yourself in this beautiful world!

Exactly 6 months ago, when your beautiful mother gave birth to you, it was the most beautiful and the happiest moment of our lives.  You came early as a premature kid of 7 months, probably because we couldn’t wait for more to see you and hold you in our arms. You were so tiny and we had a wave of fear and anxiety for the next 50 days until your doctor finally told that you were healthy and we need not worry. I have all the respect and love (I expect the same from you) for your mother and grandmother who brought their heart out to care, nurture and love you through those difficult days. I was a mere spectator who could only selflessly pray that you get healthier. Come, see yourself how you looked on that very special day when you waved us your first “Hi!”
